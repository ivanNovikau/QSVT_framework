# QSVT_framework
QSVT and QSP Hamiltonian simulations and matrix inversion

## Prepare the code:
The code uses QuEST quantum emulator (https://github.com/quest-kit/QuEST).
One needs to clone the QuEST repository.
Then, create the global bash variable $QuESTHome to store the absolute path to the QuEST/ folder.
